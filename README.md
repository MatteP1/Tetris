# Tetris
Tetris implemented with only basic Java frameworks!

The implementation is based on an [old implementation of mine](https://github.com/MatteP1/TetrisClassic), but refactored to use a plethora of software design patterns and clean code principles. However, ugly artifacts from the original implementation might remain!

## Uninstall
Simply delete the `Tetris.jar` file, and navigate to your documents folder and delete `TetrisConfig.cfg`, if it exists.
